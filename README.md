# ML-Learning-Tracker-Repo (setup in progress)
## What is this repository?
> As I have been learning ML/DS for about 2 years on my own, I wanted a way to track my work and progress. I hope that this will allow me to appreciate the work I have done and motivate to continue learning. Although some of the initial commits are things that I did in the past, I hope this repo becomes a place where I track all my ML work and learning. 
## About my background
> If anyone besides me ever reads this, I am a third year Computer Science major at UC Riverside. I have been interested in ML since about my freshman year of high school and initially wanted to pursue graduate school. However, the prospect of school isn't exciting for me as of right now. I also know that most people in ML/DS have graduate degrees so I realized that I needed to teach myself to work with ML libraries and create interesting projects so that I have a better chance of breaking into the industry. So, after teaching myself for the past couple years, I decided that it would be smart to track as "evidence" of what I know.
## Organization of Repo
> Currently this Repository will be organized by the type of ML problem the project is about. This will include things like classification, regression, RL, recommendation systems, and computer vision.
