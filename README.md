# ML-Learning-Tracker-Repo (setup in progress)
## What is this repository?
> As I have been learning ML/DS for about 2 years on my own, I wanted a way to track my work and progress. I hope that this will allow me to appreciate the work I have done and motivate to continue learning. Although some of the initial commits are things that I did in the past, I hope this repo becomes a place where I track all my ML work and learning.
